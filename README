This is work in progress just like any security app should be.
Use at your own discretion.

1. About Security.VCL
=====================

Security.VCL aims to provide:
 - A standardized framework for security-related filters
 - Several core rule-sets
 - A tool to generate Security.VCL modules from mod_security rules.
 - A limited set of default 'handlers', for instance CGI scripts to call
   upon when Bad Stuff happens.

This is done mainly by using clever VCL, and with as little impact on
normal operation as possible. The incident handlers are mainly CGI-like
scripts on a backend.

2. Basic usage
==============

To use Security.VCL, you currently have to:

$ cd vcl/
$ make
$ cd ..
$ ln -s $PWD/vcl/ /etc/varnish/security.vcl/ 

then you edit your default.vcl and add this line near the top:

	include "/etc/varnish/security.vcl/main.vcl";

At this point, you should only need to reload your varnish configuration.

You may have to or want to modify config.vcl to fit your needs. 
Remember that paths must be hardcoded and absolute.

3. The Architecture
===================

Security.VCL currently have two categories of rules: rules generated from
mod_security, located in vcl/breach/ and our own rules, vcl/modules/.

Security.VCL works by including all modules, then defining a number of
standard functions. Each module will set X-SEC-Severity = "N", where N is the
severity, and call sec_handler which in turn typically calls error or some other handler.

4. Handlers
===========

The general concept is that security.VCL either throws an error 
(vcl_error) of some kind, which can return a redirect the client,
or do any other synthetic response, or Security.VCL can log, 
rewrite the original request and send it to a backend
designed to do more clever things, like:

- Block the client in a firewall
- Log the event
- Test-run the code.
- Paint you a pretty picture....
- ....

There are several handlers defined and you can set the default handler in handlers.vcl.
The default handler rejects detected malicious traffic.

Also you may write your own handler, see handlers.vcl
